# Distributed Systems

Projects and Assignments related to the Distributed Systems course. The assignments were performed on the Ceph file system. The first part of the assignment involved benchmarking the file system on data-read workload, data-write workload and metadata workload and analyzing the throughput and latency of the filesystem operations over different replication factors and different storage systems (persistent HDD over SSD). 

The second part of the assignment involved injecting faults into the Ceph filesystem to study its vulnerabilities. The faults were injected using the CORDS framework that was developed at the University of Wisconsin, Madison
